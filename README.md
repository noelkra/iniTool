## What is this tool?
iniTool is a simple tool to watch and edit multiple .ini files at once.

### How does it work?
It searches for specific .ini Files in Folders beginning with a specified prefix 
and checks the content of them if it complies with the given settings. This means that many files can be processed simultaneously.

### Does it work for me?
It will! You have to compile it yourself at the moment but it will work.
Please note that this is primary an internal Project so i will first fullfill the requirements given from my company.
I will extend the program to get more flexible in the near future.

### Can I request features?
Absolutely! Just post an issue with the "Feature request"-Template. I will look into it and try to implement it if
I think its a good idea. 

### Why's developement taking so long?
I'm neither a fully trained professional nor do I know all best practices. So I'll have to learn the things first I'm implementing :)
