## What is this tool?
ini-Files are a common way to save configurations on Windows. This tool let's you edit ini-files easy and fast and compare them to given requirements. Use this tool to change similar settings of many files at the same time. 
### Features

 - Fast, simple and secure way to edit ini-files
 - Edit multiple files at once
 - Tested for 20'000 files at once!
 - Simple and modern material-design GUI

### How does it work?
It searches for specific .ini Files in Folders beginning with a specified prefix 
and checks the content of them if it complies with the given settings. This means that many files can be processed simultaneously.

### Does it work for me?
It will!
Please note that this is primary an internal Project so i will first fullfill the requirements given from my company. **The Application has currently many features which are specific for the usage there so it may not show all data you want to see.**
I 'm planning to create a Branch for the universally usable Version in the near feature.

### Can I request features?
Absolutely! I'm happy about all kinds of feedback or suggestions for improvement. Just post an issue with the "Feature request" or "Feedback"- Template. I will look into it and try to implement it if I think its a good idea. 

### Why's development taking so long?
I'm neither a fully trained professional nor do I know all best practices. So I'll have to learn the things first I'm implementing :)
